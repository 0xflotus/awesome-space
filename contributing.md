Please make sure that your pull request follows the following guidelines:

- The addition is related to space exploration, commercial space, DIY space and astronomy projects, space science, cosmology, or related fields.
- You've ensured that your link isn't already on the site, or already suggested in an outstanding or closed pull request.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Additions should be added in alphabetical order in the relevant category.
- Include a description of the resource along with a name and url.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
